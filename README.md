Get involved!
=============

We welcome new contributors - we hope you find getting involved both easy and fun.

[More ways to get involved with the wider project](http://www.blocked.org.uk/get-involved).

You are welcome to contribute towards any open issue - but please consider working on the ones labelled `ready` if you can. These are the issues our community thinks would be most valuable to close next. You can see these presented in order of value on waffle.io: [![Stories in Next](https://badge.waffle.io/openrightsgroup/cmp-issues.png?label=ready&title=To+do+next)](https://waffle.io/openrightsgroup/cmp-issues).

We prefer to work using the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

0. [Create a github account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already.
1. Leave a comment on an issue if you want to work on it. Feel free to include any thoughts, questions or ideas you might have for closing the issue, either in the same comment or subsequent ones. Please don't start working on issues that are `in progress` and assigned to someone else without checking with that person first.
2. Fork the repository and make your changes on a new branch with an appropriate name.
3. Send a pull request with your changes once they're complete.

When you let us know that you'd like to work on an issue we'll assign it to you and label it as `in progress` so others can see it's being worked on. If this is the first time we've worked together we'll also add you to our [helpers team](https://github.com/orgs/openrightsgroup/teams/helpers). You don't have to wait for any of this to happen before you get started though!

When you send us a pull request we will review it as soon as possible. Please consider tagging your request with an issue number so we can see which issue it addresses.

People who contribute positively will be added to the [CMP team](https://github.com/orgs/openrightsgroup/teams/cmp) (if they want) so they can commit directly, manage issues, merge pull requests, etc.

We really appreciate your help - thank you!

Feel free to contact @graphiclunarkid or a member of the @cmp team if you have any questions or need more information.
